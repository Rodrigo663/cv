    <h1 style="font-family: Arial Black;">Summary</h1>
    <p style='font-family:Arial;'><font size='5'>Basically people who sleep have their muscule that help them to stand, now are completly relaxed. And the brain block sense in the talamo. We lost time perception during sleep but our unconseius still count it. In dreams time can run slower becauseÂ the memories are displayed slower. In 50s they discovered a pattern in cerebral waves, and then was created the sleep cycle, the NREM is used to exclude all old information and REM is used to renew some ones. You need to take care to not lost one of them. And we can see that when we are asleep, brain wavesÂ are unsycronized, in NREM they are synchronized and with a low fequency.Â 
        Our NREM has a low frequency, but it allows different parts of the brain to communicate with each other. And you can see that it helps us to store the recent memories while in REM sleep we strength our memories connections. And you can see that the REM sleep is the only where our body stays completly relax to avoid the dreams to come true. We can see that even the most primitive verm sleep and various species of animals have incredible different time and ways to sleep. It depends a lot in the environment, brain system, metabolism,Â social actives and food availability. We also see that mamals and birds are the only that have REM sleep. But inÂ marine mammals is quite different because while in water they can't feel completly relax, otherwise they die. We can see that neither NREM nor REM are more important than each other, researches have figured out it on varioius studies, the brain always try to recover both. Another cool diference is that in marine mamals, like dolphins while one part of their brain is sleeping the other is full active, it occures because thehy canÂ´t fell complelty relax in this environment. Birds also have feel the same phenomemnon, one eye is opend and the other is completly close and sleeping, but when birds are in groups many of them are 100 % sleeping, while two of the tip are 50 % awake to guarantee the security. Humans can also feel it a little, not when they are home, but when they sleep in unkwon places, one side of the brains tends to be more active than the other in the first nights. This variation canÂ´t be feeling in REM sleep in any living being, it proves that REM requires 100 % of brainÂ´s relaxtion. In extreme cases many animals can feel sleep destitution, like orcs and his nestling while coming back from the birthplace or inÂ  birds while having the inter oceanic migration, they can fall asleep for some seconds and it keeps they active and alive (humans doesnÂ´t have this abilityðŸ˜ž ).Â

        <font size='5'>                O pardal branco Ã© incrivel pois em uma determinada Ã©poca do year it is immune of sleep privation, but in the other age, he feels really sick and bad! Humans were geneticly designed to have a biphasic sleep, the first during the early night to early morning and the second in the afternoon, between 30 to 60 minutes. Human sleep is quite different from other primates, we sleep less than them, 8 hours and they between 10 to 15. We also have a bigger ratio of REM sleep, 20 to 25%, bigger than any other animal. Other cool difference is that we sleep in the ground instead of trees, because you have a lower risk to suffer a fall. Homo erectus was the first to stop sleeping on the trees, and he used fire to be protected. Nature made their sleep envlove and that's why it got more intense and short. It made possible a longer REM sleeping.Â  And what are the benefits of a REM sleep? Simple: First it guages andÂ strengthens the emotional circuits what increased our Emotional IQ, what make possible humans to cooperate in large scale. Second, REM sleep boosts our criativity because it anylize new memories connect them to old and generates new insights. Babies while in their mother, they haveÂ aÂ lotÂ of REM sleep, but no controll of their body that way mother fells the baby moving. REM sleep rise during they are being developing, and few time before being born they have incredibly 12 hours of REM sleep, more than ever. But why so much? Well is because it promotes the brain connections growth. Not only in humans, but all mammals. Authist kids have less REM sleep, and also a different cycradian cycle. Many researches accociate the lack of REM sleep, in the early days to social animals and brain undevelopment. Alchol also promotes undevelopment on babies. The quality of neural networks also decrease. In childhood, kids have a polifasic sleeping, different from adults.Â  But their cycradian cycle is build in childhood, according to the environment. The NREM-REM sleep ratio during gestation is 50/50 but it changes a lot and in adulthood is it 80/20. Why more NREM? Because we don't to expand the brain anymore, but to trim the connections in parts of the brain that don't use it and to streengh in parts that need it more. Because we know our nature mother is not perfect in building so it changes according to the environment. So we can say that an important function of NREM sleep is to trim parts of the brain. Irwin Feinberg have led a research with people between 6 to 18 years old. He discovered that during the teenhood, the NREM sleep intensity increases a lot, indicating new parts of the brain being rembuilt. But it is made selectively and by parts, starting by the back of the brain, developing vision and space til the front. The last part is the lobal frontal, responsible for reasoning and critical decisions. ðŸ˜‰ Well maybe if weÂ analyze diseases like esquizofrenia, people who carry these pysicological diseases is because maybe they suffer from a privation from NREM sleep. Well, teenager suffer also a change in their circadian rythim, is incredibly, from 9 am their melatonin levels only starts to increase at 10 out mid night. So they also need more sleep and to wake up later. But what does it happend? Maybe nature mom did it to make teenager to have some hours alone, without their parents and with friends. And it is important to develop independency from parents. And when they finally became adult and mature, then finally everything change and their cycle settle down. Is a myth that old people need less time of sleeping, but they simply can't reach the same time of the adults, but they try. If we look to the NREM quality and amout, we can see that it decreases a lot as people get older. At 40 years, people have lost 50 % to 60 % of NREM sleep, and in more advanced age, is 80% to even 90%. Another thing is that old people have a weak bladder and thatÂ´s why they donÂ´t have 100% of efficiency in their sleep because they need to wake up all the time! Their cyrcadian rythim also change, and they fall asleep earlier, and sometimes the nap at the night can complicate their sleep later. Mathew discoverd that the parts that get deteriorate earlier are exacly that parts that generate NREM sleep. But it only explain 60 % of the deteriotation, because it can also be associated with the Prothein beta-ameloide.

<p style='font-family:Arial;'><font size='5'>            We know that NREM sleep boosts our memory, and maybe thatÂ´s why is so hard for old people to learn and to memorize new things. So we know that the sleep deteriotation in elderies are the main cause of many of their problems and diseases. The first incredible benefit of sleep for the brain is memory retention. Scients have discovered that even a simple nap can help you to learn things more efieciently. But how does it happend? It happens in NREM sleep, in the light sleep, when our brain in transmiting eletricÂ  currents over the brain called, sleep spindles. And it transmits information from the hippocampus (short terms memory, with a limited space) to the cortex (long term memories and with more security). But it also helps you after learning and NREM sleep do it also. It simply do the same thing with the sleep spindles, and thatÂ´s why they are so powerful repeating this cycle every night. And obvius, old people have less sleep spindles. Scients in Germany made a research with people that learned new things and then whenÂ these people went to bed they stimulate the electric waves in NREM sleep with more electric waves in half of them and it improved a lot their learning. It also worked with sound, not only with electric waves.Â  Walker have met with a pianist that said that he used to practice with persistence at night, with many mistakes. But in the morning he simply could play a diffcult part naturally. Walker made a study in Harvard with students that practiced piano a lot, with many mistakes too and 12 hours later they started to play again. The ones who sleeped 8 hours had a better performance and they seem to play it naturally. And it is what our barin does during the last phase of NREM sleep in the last hours of night. It takes recent motor skills and bring it neural circuits under consciousness. And thatÂ´s why is different from text/image memories because it happend 'naturally'. Walker also adviced many top athletes around the world that sleep imporoves a lot everything, their resistence, force, speed and breathe. He has also seen it with people who suffered from strokeor other condition that paralyzed their muscles. The sleep try to create new connections in the affected area and it also improve their motor skills. Little lack of sleep can affect a lot your concentration, because of the micro sleeps, that last for 2 seconds and you stay complelty with no reaction and idle.Â  David Dignes made a reasearh and found out that a total sleep privation can affect a lot your reaction, because you simply donÂ´t react. And also people who sleeps 6 hours per night can also have the same complications, and after someÂ  time this people simple accept this cronic privation of sleep. After 16 hours our brain starts to fail, so we need more than 7 hours of sleep. And also sleep privation is much worse than alchol when it comes to drive. Dingnes also discoverd than power naps can help just like caffeine, but not for a long time.... Emotions are also affected by the lack of sleep, but is the sleep that provides a strong connection between the cortex and the amidala, that is responsible by intense emotions.Â  This connection controll not only the amidala, but also some other parts that are responsible by reward felling and witha lot of dopamine. ThatÂ´s why a lack of sleep can encourage you to find new pleasures, like drugs! Reasearches also discovered that sleep can improve pacients with many pysiciatric diseases like Bipolar! Is it worth it to spend the hole night studying for a test? Walker led a research where some students who didÂ´nt sleep needed to learn new things in the other day, and compared to the students who had a good night of sleep, well they have learned almost nothing, because of their weak and unhealthy hippocampus! And basically, sleep privation canÂ´t only prevent your brain to build new connections but it also can perturb the production of the proteins that helps to buil new synapses.Â  Stickgold also led a research where many people leanred new things and he discovered that after three days of good sleep, people could remember more things than the ones who were tested one day after. And he also discovered that even after seeping two night after having a sleep privation, you still will get stuck when trying to remember, because more sleep canÂ´t not repair completly the damage caused by one night of sleep privation! Another cool thing is that if we anylize the parts of the brain where Amyloid betaÂ that causes Alzheimer affects are that ones that are responsible by NREM sleep! And the sleep privation also increases the production of this protein, because in our brain there is the glinfatic system, and it is made by the glia cells. Its function is to clean the brain and remove all the toxic substances. It cleans all of this stuff 90% during sleep, and one of this substances is the beta ameloide and the tau! So in the long-term, sleep privation increases the beta ameloide and increases the chances of you getting Alzheimer!Â

    <p style='font-family:Arial;'><font size='5'>            With heart diseases is not different, several studies showed that your changes of getting strokes or other heart issues can increase between 200% to 500% with people who lost even only one or two hours of sleep. Sleep privation can lead to inflation of arteries, and also the formation of calcium plaques causing atherosclerosis. But where does it come from? From the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for the send of single messages for all the body systems: Fight or flee. Usually it only lasts for seconds or minutes, but sleep privation can make it to be active for a long period of time, and it becomes chronic, leading to all of this diseases. And is the NREM sleep that regulates the sympatic system during sleep, thatÂ´s why this system wonÂ´t be causing hypertension and heart accelaration. Besides avoiding the high production of cortisol and increasing the production of the one who regulates growing. Researches have also discovered that after one week sleeping 5 hours a day, the glucose absorption of their cells decreased 40 %.Â  So they became pre-diabetic. </font></p>

<p style='font-family: Arial;'><font size='5'>Sleep privation can also provoke an lack of controll in the production of the hormone grelina (responsible by the increase of the appetite) and leptin (responsible by the controll of the appetite). And also it can make you more willing to eat foods rich in carbohydrate and sugar. Join this facts to the one that you are going to be less disposed to exercise, sleep privation is the fundamental key for the gain of weight!</font></p>
<p style='font-family: Arial;'><font size='5'>In the reproductive system, it can decrease the testosterone production so much, that youÂ´re going to look like a 60 years old man! And testosterone make men less tired and more focused. And they also will have a bigger testicle and a bigger libido!</font></p>
<p style='font-family: Arial;'><font size='5'>In the immune system sleep not also increase its strength, but also boosts your immune system reaction to vaccines. And we need to see the fact that the immune system also fight against cancer. Studies have shown that the sympatic system also provoke an inflamotory response to prepare the body for injuries. But this inflamotory response can also help to boost the cancerÂ´s spread along the body and also mutates its DNA to be come stonger and more agressive. They also contribute to the developing of new blood vessels in the tumor making it more self sufficient!</font></p>
